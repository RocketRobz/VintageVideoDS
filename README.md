# Vintage Video DS
Play short videos (up to 30 seconds) in B&W, as .nds files

By adding up to 240 video frames (a video in 8fps) (in B&W/grayscale, 4bpp) and sound in 8khz to the source code (examples included), you'll get a .nds file containing your video.    
To try out one of the examples below, go into `arm9` folder, move `graphics` and `music` out of the example's folder to `arm9`, then exit `arm9` and run `make.bat` or `clean and make.bat`.`

# Examples included
* Mario Kart 8 commercial (Upside-Down Test)
* Tomodachi Life commercial (Christina Aguilera as a Mii)
